Women are caught in webs, spin ′em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop Amoxicillin's just not real enough The criminal cop killin′, hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You′re coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin′ up? Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I′ma rip this shit till my bone collapse I′ma rip this shit till my bone collapse! Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over, just admit when it′s at its end Because I′m at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list that it′s in It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy So when I′m not put on this list, the shit does not offend me That's why you see me walk around Like nothing′s bothering me Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney; Nate, hit me! Till my legs give out, can′t shut my mouth Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart And it′s absurd how people hang on every word I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I′ll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse That's why I′m clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I′m an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I′m Kim Mathers But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack I′m launching at 'em The track is on some battling raps, who want some static? ′Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is whack if I′m not the baddest! I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse! Until the roof (until the roof) The roof comes off (the roof comes off) Until my legs (until my legs) Give out from (underneath me) I will not fall, I will stand tall Feels like no one can beat me.",hiphop/rap,700
