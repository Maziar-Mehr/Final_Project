## Project Brief
Boundaries that divide music genres are fuzzy and the passing of time augments this even more. Hip-hop is a very lyric-heavy genre and many of the key descriptive metrics that describe lyric count for hip-hop are different from all other genres. Accordingly, hip hop genre is a great fit for this project but this method can be used for any other music genre that contains lyrics.
 
**Description :**
In this venture, I dived into how natural langue processing can be applied to build a lyrics-based song recommender. First, I automated the Spotify app with python to find the lyrics of the current song playing using Spotify API and BeautifulSoup. Besides, I created the lyrics data frame using web scraping from a couple of different online sources. Finally, after Embedding the lyrics by using Universal Sentence Encoder I clustered them using the K-means method.

**Challenge:**
Automate Spotify with Python (Spotify API) and Text Embedding and Clustering. 

**Advanced Analysis & Data Scientist Techniques :**
- Data Visualisation to show or interactively explore trends, patterns, relationships
- Scraping data or utilising APIs to collect data, which will need cleaning, wrangling
- NLP: unstructured data, text and sentiment analysis


## Data & Visualization
The raw [data](https://github.com/Maziar-Mehr/Final_Project/tree/main/Data) contains the lyrics of 274 songs from 12 different Hip-Hop artists. The 
dashboard below shows the frequency of the words in this data set.

## Tools
I used the following tools to achieve the objective.
