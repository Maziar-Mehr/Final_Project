## Project Brief
Boundaries that divide music genres are fuzzy and the passing of time augments this even more. Hip-hop is a very lyric-heavy genre and many of the key descriptive metrics that describe lyric count for hip-hop are different from all other genres. Accordingly, hip hop genre is a great fit for this project but this method can be used for any other music genre that contains lyrics.
 
**Description :**
The first step of this project is to automate the Spotify app with python to use the Spotify API and then get the lyrics of the song that is currently playing on the Spotify App by scrapping. Besides, I created a lyrics data frame by scrapping several sources online (Genius and Musixmatch ...). One of the main challenges in this project is encoding and clustering the lyrics. There are so many methods available out there for text encoding and clustering but I used the Universal sentence encoder because is suitable for large texts.

**Challenge:**
Automate Spotify with Python (Spotify API) and Text Embedding and Clustering. 

**Advanced Analysis & Data Scientist Techniques :**
- Data Visualisation to show or interactively explore trends, patterns, relationships
- Scraping data or utilising APIs to collect data, which will need cleaning, wrangling
- NLP: unstructured data, text and sentiment analysis


## Data & Visualization
The raw [data](https://github.com/Maziar-Mehr/Final_Project/tree/main/Data) contains the lyrics of 274 songs from 12 different Hip-Hop artists. The 
dashboard below shows the frequency of the words in this data set.

## Tools
I used the following tools to achieve the objective.
